🌈 Color Personality Checker (Java Console Application)

A beginner-friendly Java console application that allows users to enter a color name and receive a meaningful description or personality trait associated with that color.
This project was built as part of my internship to practice Java basics, user input, conditional logic, and console interaction.

🚀 Features

Prompt user to enter a color name

Predefined meanings for common colors:

Red → Passion, Energy, Confidence

Blue → Calmness, Trust, Intelligence

Green → Growth, Balance, Harmony

Yellow → Happiness, Optimism, Creativity

Black → Power, Mystery, Elegance

White → Purity, Simplicity, Peace

Purple → Royalty, Wisdom, Spirituality

Cyan → Freshness, Clarity, Inspiration

Input is case-insensitive (e.g., Red, RED, red all work)

If color not in list → display a friendly error message

Option to check multiple colors in one session (loop until user types no)

Uses switch-case for cleaner logic

Colorful console output using ANSI escape codes

Motivational quotes for each color
